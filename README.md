# GhareebM-Analyst-Building-a-classification-machine-model-using-imbalanced-dataset

In this project, classification machine learning model was developed after testing different approaches of balancing the data.
The first accompanied [jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/GhareebM-Analyst-Building-a-classification-machine-model-using-imbalanced-dataset/blob/main/Data-processing.ipynb) contains:
-	Data analysis
-	Features engineering
-	Code for saving data in .csv formate


The second accompanied [jupyter notebook]( https://github.com/GhareebM-Analyst/GhareebM-Analyst-Building-a-classification-machine-model-using-imbalanced-dataset/blob/main/Modeling.ipynb) contains:
Comparing performance of selected algorithms  (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBClassifier) on data obtained using under-sampling, over-sampling, Cost-sensitive learning, and Ensemble methods.
